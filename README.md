# Knowledge Representation in the Semantic Web
The course comprised 2 assignments and a 2 member-team project.
# Assignment 1

The first assignment focused on: 
* XML (eXtensible Markup Language): Encoding documents in a human-readable and machine-readable format.
* XSD (XML Schema Definition): Defining the structure and data types for XML documents.
* XPath (XML Path Language): Navigating through elements and attributes in an XML document.
* XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations): Transforming XML documents into other formats, such as HTML.

# Assignment 2

The second assignment involved creating an RDFS university ontology. This ontology included:
* Classes: University departments, professors, students, courses, and classrooms.
* Properties: Relationships such as which professors teach which courses, which students are enrolled in which courses, and which departments offer which courses.

SPARQL queries were executed using the university ontology.

# Project

The project entailed creating a zoo ontology using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the tool Protégé. 

Protégé was used to model the ontology, define classes and properties, set up relationships and constraints, and visualize and test the ontology.
